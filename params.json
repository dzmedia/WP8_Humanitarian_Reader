{"name":"Wp8 humanitarian reader","tagline":"This is a demo app I made for the blogs I published to MSDN talking about how easy the new Windows Phone 8 project templates and tools made localizing one's app. ","body":"###I heart Loc\r\nI got very excited by the world of localization and globalization when I owned such features in the Windows Phone world for a release cycle. It was great to be a part of integration with the fabulous <a href=\"https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Introducing-Windows-8/Introduction-to-the-Multilingual-App-Toolkit\">Multilingual App Toolkit</a> and to make common cause with the really impressive <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/translator\">Microsoft Translator</a> team from MS Research. Between us, we took the dev experience of localizing a WP app from a multistep research and trial and error project to pretty close to free as part of any project generated with a Visual Studio New Project template. \r\n\r\n###How to Best Show Windows Phone Loc Features?\r\nI realized there was a historical gap around providing Windows Phone app devs with all the info they needed to motivate them to localize their apps. I wanted to provide a good dynamic demo but finding time for extensive design and refinement was tough. I ended up finding an on line source of localized data (International Committee of the Red Cross news RSS feed) and structuring the demo features around the idea of switching language dynamically within the app. Using Arabic, Chinese, English, and Spanish feeds allowed me to demonstrate many of the basic principles:\r\n* Separation of UI and both local and service-delivered localized resources\r\n* Complex script display\r\n* Both Right to Left and Left to Right text and navigation elements\r\n* UI elements that don't localize (ie. language selection menu)\r\n\r\n###What I wrote\r\nHere are the items I authored around this demo app, the Multilingual App Toolkit and localization for WP in general:\r\n* <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/ff637520(v=vs.105).aspx\">How to build a localized app for Windows Phone 8 </a>\r\n* <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/ff967550(v=vs.105).aspx\">How to localize an app title for Windows Phone 8</a>  \r\n* <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh202920(v=vs.105).aspx\">Font and language configuration support for Windows Phone 8</a> \r\n* <a href=\"http://blogs.windows.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/archive/2013/02/01/tips-for-localizing-windows-phone-8-xaml-apps-part1.aspx\">MSDN blog: Tips for Localizing Windows Phone 8 XAML apps - Part1</a>         \r\n* <a href=\"http://blogs.windows.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/archive/2013/03/08/tips-for-localizing-windows-phone-apps-part-2.aspx\">MSDN blog: Tips for localizing Windows Phone apps â€“ Part 2</a> \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
